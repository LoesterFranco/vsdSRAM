# SRAM

## SRAM Design
This Project mainly focuses on the design of 4kB SRAM memory using opensource memory compiler **OpenRAM**. For the design of custom memory array, memory compiler takes in SPICE netlists, Layout files of the custom cells designed and few other parameters and generates a SRAM memory array.

SRAM Specs - Memory Size of **4kBytes** with operating voltage of **1.8V** and access time of less than **2.5ns**.
